<!-- First step is thinking of what you want to build and what you want it to do. Then for inspiration look at templates of what people have already built and try to recreate it somehow using html and basic css. Then go to JS and update functionality. Study this to see how the elments are all broken up for styling and also to be used in JS! the id's used as constants in js that can be updated using .innerHTML -->
